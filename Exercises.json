Having the hands higher than the feet makes it easier than wide-grip push-ups on the floor, but the extra width also puts more emphasis on the chest muscles.

    "Description": "The wide-grip bench press is a compound exercise targeting the chest and, to a lesser extent, the triceps. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands are placed farther apart on the bar. Many lifters find they can handle more weight going wide than with narrower grips, although it's also worth noting that plenty of banged-up lifters have said benching with a wide grip may also have contributed to their shoulder injuries and pain. The wide-grip bench is often used as a chest-building movement in chest or upper-body workouts, or as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press.",

No matter how you perform it, it targets both the anterior and medial deltoids, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day.",

No matter how you structure the sets and reps, it is a time-efficient way to hit two crucial upper-body muscles in any workout.",
