If you have a android device it is highly recommended to download the expo go application right now, the steps still apply to all:

1) run `'npm install'` in the terminal (make sure node is installed in your computer as it is needed to run npm)
2) run in the terminal `'npx expo start'`
3) if you have installed expo go scan the qr code shown
4) if you havent installed expo go follow this link to download an android emulator, it is crucial to follow every step https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/#how-to-find-installed-platform-tools-location
5) after installation close VScode and re-open the folder
6) run `'npx expo start'`
7) when QR code appears click `'SHIFT+a'`
8) choose the android emulator (that shouldve been downloaded and would appear in the list here after you follow the steps in the link provided)
